bachelor's graduation work
**"Development of a technique for predicting solar proton fluxes using artificial neural networks"**

Predicting the proton fluxes of solar cosmic rays in a wide range of energies is an actual problem since these flows have a significant effect on the radiation conditions in outer space. Therefore, the creation of an automatic system capable of predicting the dynamics of solar proton events is necessary for global on-line forecasting of space weather.

You can get some information about software implementation og this project in project Wiki. Full text of my graduation work will be available soon.
